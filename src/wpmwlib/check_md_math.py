"""
Markdown LaTeX-math linter for the WPMW project.

Catches the rendering pitfalls we have actually hit on GitHub:

1. **Static** — patterns GitHub's MathJax config rejects even though vanilla
   MathJax/KaTeX would accept them (e.g. ``\\operatorname``, ``\\bm``,
   ``\\href``). These cause a visible "macro is not allowed" error in the
   rendered page.
2. **GFM** — backslash-escaped TeX shortcuts that GitHub's *markdown*
   preprocessor strips before the math is handed to MathJax, because
   CommonMark treats ``\\X`` (where X is ASCII punctuation) as an escape.
   ``\\,`` becomes a literal comma, ``\\!`` a literal bang, ``\\bigl\\{``
   becomes ``\\bigl{`` — the last produces a hard "Missing or unrecognized
   delimiter for \\bigl" error; the others corrupt spacing silently.
   ``\\%`` is the sharpest case: it becomes a literal ``%``, which opens a
   LaTeX comment running to end of line and silently truncates the rest
   of the expression, including the closing ``$`` — this produced a hard
   "comment has no terminating newline" error in practice
   (``docs/analysis/fourd_microdynamics.md``, 2026-08).

   Fenced ``\\`\\`\\`math`` blocks are **exempt** from this strip (verified
   empirically), so the GFM pass is only applied to ``$...$`` and
   ``$$...$$`` expressions. The render passes likewise feed fenced content
   to the engines verbatim, while dollar-delimited content is stripped first.
3. **Structural** — multi-line ``$$...$$`` blocks placed inside a list item.
   GitHub's markdown preprocessor silently fails to recognise these as math,
   then re-tokenises the indented ``+`` / ``-`` lines as nested bullet items.
   No error message — just garbled output.
4. **Render (KaTeX, optional)** — every expression is fed to KaTeX in strict
   mode *after* applying GitHub's CommonMark backslash-strip transformation,
   so the engine sees what GitHub actually feeds the renderer rather than
   the raw source. Catches malformed LaTeX surviving the strip.
5. **Render (MathJax, optional)** — same expressions through MathJax 3 with
   only the ``base`` and ``ams`` packages loaded, matching GitHub's actual
   config. Catches undefined macros (``\\thickspace``, ``\\medspace``, ...)
   that MathJax with the AllPackages set would silently render as raw text.

The two render passes need ``node`` plus the ``katex`` and ``mathjax-full``
npm packages.  When those aren't available the passes are skipped with a
warning; the static, GFM, and structural passes always run.

Run as a CLI from the repository root::

    python -m wpmwlib.check_md_math docs/

Math expressions are extracted from ``$...$`` inline math, ``$$...$$``
display math, and ``\\`\\`\\`math``-fenced display math.

Exits 0 if clean, 1 if any issues found.

# 2. Extract math expressions from the (code-stripped) text.                  #
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
#
# Discovered bug (August 2026): strip_code()'s generic inline-code regex
# used to blank *every* single-backtick span, with no exception for one
# that is itself the content-carrier of a ``$`...`$`` math expression. That
# ran before this module ever looked for the backtick-dollar form, so
# ``$`K`$`` was silently reduced to ``$   $`` before extraction. Two
# consequences, one silent and repo-wide, one loud and specific to this
# file:
#
#   1. (Repo-wide, silent.) Every ``$`...`$`` expression in the tree —
#      the project's preferred inline-math form, ~1,376 occurrences —
#      was excluded from the KaTeX/MathJax render pass. `extract_math()`
#      never received the backticks needed to find them, so `scan_paths()`
#      was, in effect, only render-checking the far rarer plain ``$...$``
#      form. Confirmed by probe: ``$`\alpha_`$`` (invalid — trailing `_`
#      with no group) passed with 0 issues under the old regex and is
#      correctly flagged once the exemption below is in place.
#
#   2. (This file, loud.) Two ``$`...`$`` spans glued directly together
#      with no separating whitespace — ``$`0`$–$`2`$`` at
#      interworld_coupling.md:493 — left the residue ``$   $–$   $`` after
#      blanking. The *plain*-math regex then ran on that residue and found
#      a spurious pair: the leftover closing `$` of the first span and the
#      opening `$` of the second, with the single character between them
#      (the en dash) read as the entire expression. KaTeX correctly
#      rejected that dash as an unrecognised bare Unicode symbol; see
#      §4g below for the corresponding static check.
#
# Fix: strip_code() (§1) now matches the `$`...`$` form as its own atomic
# alternative and leaves it untouched, so extract_math() below is the
# only place that ever consumes it.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# GitHub's markdown preprocessor applies CommonMark backslash-escape rules
# *inside* math content, even though it shouldn't — any ``\X`` where X is an
# ASCII-punctuation character is rewritten to literal ``X`` before the math
# is handed to MathJax.  This corrupts the most common TeX shortcuts.
#
# Two safe replacement strategies:
#   * **Letter-named macro** — works only when the macro is defined in
#     MathJax's base+ams package set, which is what GitHub uses. ``\,``,
#     ``\!``, ``\{``, ``\}`` have working letter-named alternatives;
#     ``\;`` (thick space) and ``\:`` (medium space) DO NOT — their
#     letter-named forms ``\thickspace`` and ``\medspace`` are not defined
#     in MathJax 3 base+ams and render as raw text on GitHub.
#   * **Doubled backslash** — universal: ``\\;`` is parsed by CommonMark
#     as escaped-backslash (``\``) followed by literal ``;``, leaving
#     ``\;`` for MathJax. Works for every short form because the underlying
#     short forms are all in MathJax's base package.
#
# The recommendations below pick the simpler form when it's known to work,
# and fall back to doubled-backslash when there's no working letter-named
# alternative.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Per CommonMark §6.1, an underscore opens emphasis when it is left-flanking.
# The rule permits emphasis to open when `_` is followed by non-whitespace AND
# preceded by any Unicode punctuation character.  A closing brace `}` is the
# most common trigger (subscript right after a group: `V^{(2)}_{\vec q}`), but
# any ASCII punctuation before `_` is equally broken:
#
#   `}_q`, `}_0`, `}_{`  — subscript after closing brace (most common)
#   `'_i`, `'_m`, `'_{`  — subscript after prime (x'_i, f'_{n})
#   `)_n`, `|_{a}`       — subscript after closing delimiter
#
# The result is that the underscore is eaten and the whole $...$ region
# fails to render; later inline math on the same paragraph line often
# fails too (cascading).
#
# Note: `_` preceded by an ordinary letter or digit is NOT left-flanking
# by this rule, so `r_{ij}` and `\alpha_i` are safe.
#
# Fix: wrap the expression in backtick-dollar form ``$`...`$``.
# Any doubled-backslash spacing (``\\,`` ``\\;``) must be simplified to

# 4d. (Removed) "Inverted-backtick" check — tested and found unfounded.      #
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# A prior version of this linter flagged `` `$...$` `` (backtick OUTSIDE the
# dollar signs) as broken, on the theory that GitHub's math pipeline runs
# before or alongside inline-code processing, so a code span wrapping
# dollar-shaped content would still be reinterpreted as math — and that
# content containing `}_` (the emphasis trap) would then fail visually even
# inside that code span.
#
# The theory does not hold.  It was tested upstream in
# https://github.com/billpage/GitHubLinter (commit be3b197) directly against
# GitHub's own renderer (POST https://api.github.com/markdown, mode=gfm), on
# the check's own worked example `` `$\mathbb{Z}_4$` `` and on all 19 real
# instances the check was firing on there: every one rendered as a plain,
# correctly protected <code> element, with no <math-renderer> wrapper and the
# underscore left as literal text.  The bare form (no backticks) *does*
# produce <math-renderer>, confirming the API reproduces GitHub's real
# math-annotation step and that a code span which forms at all removes its
# content from consideration entirely — exactly as CommonMark requires, code
# spans having the highest inline-parsing precedence.
#
# In this repository the check produced 15 findings, every one a false
# positive on the style guide's own don't-write-this examples in
# ``src/README.md``.  Removed rather than made code-span-aware, since a
# code-span-aware version would still fire on genuine, correctly protected
# uses of the pattern.  Read the upstream commit message before reinstating.

# 4e. Hyphen-dollar scan: `-$...$` in raw markdown text.                      #
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# GitHub's math pipeline does not recognise the opening `$` as a math
# delimiter when it is immediately preceded by a hyphen-minus (`-`).  This
# mirrors the common practice of excluding `-$` to avoid ambiguity with
# negative-value dollar signs such as `-$5`.  The result is that the `$`
# is treated as a literal character and the whole expression fails to render.
#
# The same failure occurs for other non-space characters glued to the
# opening `$`.  Straight and curly quotation marks are the ones we have hit
# in practice: `"$\mu$ returns to zero,"` leaves a literal `$\mu$` on the
# rendered page.
#
# Example: `Fourier-in-$s$` — the `$s$` never renders.
# Example: `"$\mu$ returns to zero,"` — likewise.
# Fix: use the backtick-dollar form ``$`s`$``, which GitHub's parser
# recognises as a distinct construct regardless of the preceding character.

# Confirmed empirically (August 2026) against the live rendered page for

# `)` but followed by anything else (`;`, `,`, `.`, a space, end of line)
# rendered correctly, as did `)$)`-shaped sequences where the character
# before the `$` was a different closing bracket (`]$)`, `}$)`) rather than
# a round parenthesis. The bug appears specific to round parentheses on
# both sides of the delimiter, not to closing brackets generally.
#
# Example (observed on a rendered page, August 2026):
#     (writing $\Gamma$ for $\Gamma_q(x)$) — is
# leaves the literal text `$\Gamma_q(x)$` on the rendered page; the same
# expression not immediately followed by `)` (e.g. `$\Gamma_q(x)$,`)
# renders fine.

# Fix: use the backtick-dollar form ``$`...`$`` (see the emphasis-trap
# note above). Confirmed empirically to render correctly immediately
# followed by `)`, and with round parentheses inside the content.

# 4h. Unclosed backtick-math scan: `$`...` ` with the closing `$` dropped.    #
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# The backtick-dollar form is written $`...`$ -- two delimiters, a `$`
# *and* a `` ` `` on each side. Dropping the closing `$` (typically because
# a run-in bold marker or sentence-final period was typed right after the
# closing backtick, e.g. `$`(x, p)`.**`) leaves `$`(x, p)`` -- to
# CommonMark this is nothing but a literal `$` followed by an ordinary
# `` `(x, p)` `` code span. Two consequences, both silent:
#
#   1. GitHub's math-recognition step, which looks for the literal
#      ``$`...`$`` pattern before CommonMark ever runs, does not find it
#      here (the trailing `$` is missing), so the span is never protected
#      from CommonMark's own code-span parsing.
#   2. CommonMark then treats the backticks as a plain code span in the
#      normal way, and code spans are opaque -- their content is not
#      further processed. The orphaned `$` immediately in front survives
#      as literal, visible text, exactly as if it had been typed as prose.
#
# `extract_math()` does not report anything for this case either: at the
# `$` position the backtick-dollar regex requires the whole
# ``$`...`$`` pattern to match starting there and fails; the plain
# ``$...$`` regex then finds no partner `$` on the same line for the lone
# leftover sign (the second `$` on the line, if any, belongs to the next,
# *properly* closed span and is already consumed by the backtick-dollar
# pass). The malformed span is therefore invisible to every check that
# operates on extracted math expressions -- this scan has to run on raw
# text instead, the same way ``list_item_block_math`` does.
#
# Confirmed empirically (August 2026) against a live rendered page:
# ``**Not in $`(x, p)`.** Acting on $`W(x, p)`$, neither piece...`` --
# the first, malformed span left the literal fragment
# ``Not in (x, p) . Actingon`` on the page (the orphaned `$` swallowed by
# GitHub's own math-detection pass regardless, which then greedily paired
# it with the *next* line's closing ``\`$`` and rendered everything
# between -- including the intervening prose -- as one garbled math
# expression, which is also why the words lost their spaces: LaTeX math
# mode treats bare whitespace as insignificant).
# (``docs/analysis/compensated_liouville_splitting.md``, 2026-08).
#
# Fix: add the missing trailing `$`.
#
# The scan has to stay code-span-aware to avoid flagging documentation
# that *talks about* this exact syntax inside its own code spans (e.g. a
# style-guide line showing `` `$...$` `` as an example) -- a naive
# ``\$`[^`]+`(?!\$)`` regex over raw text fires on those too, since a
# `$` sitting at the end of one code span's displayed text can be
# immediately followed by the backtick that opens the *next* code span.
# Multi-backtick spans (`` `` `x` `` ``, used to show literal backticks)
# are matched and skipped as a single atomic unit first, for the same
