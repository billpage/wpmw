"""
Markdown LaTeX-math linter for the WPMW project.

Catches the rendering pitfalls we have actually hit on GitHub:

1. **Static** — patterns GitHub's MathJax config rejects even though vanilla
   MathJax/KaTeX would accept them (e.g. ``\\operatorname``, ``\\bm``,
   ``\\href``). These cause a visible "macro is not allowed" error in the
   rendered page.
2. **GFM** — backslash-escaped TeX shortcuts that GitHub's *markdown*
   preprocessor strips before the math is handed to MathJax, because
   CommonMark treats ``\\X`` (where X is ASCII punctuation) as an escape.
   ``\\,`` becomes a literal comma, ``\\!`` a literal bang, ``\\bigl\\{``
   becomes ``\\bigl{`` — the last produces a hard "Missing or unrecognized
   delimiter for \\bigl" error; the others corrupt spacing silently.

   Fenced ``\\`\\`\\`math`` blocks are **exempt** from this strip (verified
   empirically), so the GFM pass is only applied to ``$...$`` and
   ``$$...$$`` expressions. The render passes likewise feed fenced content
   to the engines verbatim, while dollar-delimited content is stripped first.
3. **Structural** — multi-line ``$$...$$`` blocks placed inside a list item.
   GitHub's markdown preprocessor silently fails to recognise these as math,
   then re-tokenises the indented ``+`` / ``-`` lines as nested bullet items.
   No error message — just garbled output.
4. **Render (KaTeX, optional)** — every expression is fed to KaTeX in strict
   mode *after* applying GitHub's CommonMark backslash-strip transformation,
   so the engine sees what GitHub actually feeds the renderer rather than
   the raw source. Catches malformed LaTeX surviving the strip.
5. **Render (MathJax, optional)** — same expressions through MathJax 3 with
   only the ``base`` and ``ams`` packages loaded, matching GitHub's actual
   config. Catches undefined macros (``\\thickspace``, ``\\medspace``, ...)
   that MathJax with the AllPackages set would silently render as raw text.

The two render passes need ``node`` plus the ``katex`` and ``mathjax-full``
npm packages.  When those aren't available the passes are skipped with a
warning; the static, GFM, and structural passes always run.

Run as a CLI from the repository root::

    python -m wpmwlib.check_md_math docs/

Math expressions are extracted from ``$...$`` inline math, ``$$...$$``
display math, and ``\\`\\`\\`math``-fenced display math.

Exits 0 if clean, 1 if any issues found.

# *inside* math content, even though it shouldn't — any ``\X`` where X is an
# ASCII-punctuation character is rewritten to literal ``X`` before the math
# is handed to MathJax.  This corrupts the most common TeX shortcuts.
#
# Two safe replacement strategies:
#   * **Letter-named macro** — works only when the macro is defined in
#     MathJax's base+ams package set, which is what GitHub uses. ``\,``,
#     ``\!``, ``\{``, ``\}`` have working letter-named alternatives;
#     ``\;`` (thick space) and ``\:`` (medium space) DO NOT — their
#     letter-named forms ``\thickspace`` and ``\medspace`` are not defined
#     in MathJax 3 base+ams and render as raw text on GitHub.
#   * **Doubled backslash** — universal: ``\\;`` is parsed by CommonMark
#     as escaped-backslash (``\``) followed by literal ``;``, leaving
#     ``\;`` for MathJax. Works for every short form because the underlying
#     short forms are all in MathJax's base package.
#
# The recommendations below pick the simpler form when it's known to work,
# and fall back to doubled-backslash when there's no working letter-named
# alternative.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Per CommonMark §6.1, an underscore opens emphasis when it is left-flanking.
# The rule permits emphasis to open when `_` is followed by non-whitespace AND
# preceded by any Unicode punctuation character.  A closing brace `}` is the
# most common trigger (subscript right after a group: `V^{(2)}_{\vec q}`), but
# any ASCII punctuation before `_` is equally broken:
#
#   `}_q`, `}_0`, `}_{`  — subscript after closing brace (most common)
#   `'_i`, `'_m`, `'_{`  — subscript after prime (x'_i, f'_{n})
#   `)_n`, `|_{a}`       — subscript after closing delimiter
#
# The result is that the underscore is eaten and the whole $...$ region
# fails to render; later inline math on the same paragraph line often
# fails too (cascading).
#
# Note: `_` preceded by an ordinary letter or digit is NOT left-flanking
# by this rule, so `r_{ij}` and `\alpha_i` are safe.
#
# Fix: wrap the expression in backtick-dollar form ``$`...`$``.
# Any doubled-backslash spacing (``\\,`` ``\\;``) must be simplified to
# ``\,`` / ``\;`` inside the backtick-dollar region (CommonMark no longer
# strips them).
